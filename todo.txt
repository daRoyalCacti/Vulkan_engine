Staging buffer (do after texture tutorial -- requires memory barriers):
    I disagree with "Change the sharingMode of resources to be VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT and specify both the graphics and transfer queue families"

    In our case, the buffer will be used only by the graphicQueue, or the transferQueue, not both at the same time.
    So, instead of using VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT, it should be better to use a memory barrier to release ownership from the graphicQueue to the transferQueue, make the copy, and release ownership from the transferQueue to the graphicQueue.


Abstract making a geneneral command buffer
    have main drawing command buffer
    and also a command buffer for creating vertex buffer
